      # - TCR applications must have at least one campaign, own or inherited
      # - Destination countries marked as main must have their required compliance
      #   documents uploaded
      # - TCR applications must state whether they inherit the organization's TCR brand
      #   and campaign
      #
      # Outcome:
      #
      # - Once the prerequisites pass and background processing succeeds, the profile's
      #   conversionFlowStatus becomes ONBOARDED and its public status reads `approved`
      # - A profile with no WhatsApp channel, or one still awaiting TCR registration or
      #   country documents, is onboarded like any other. Those are answered by the
      #   brand and campaign records, not by a status on the profile
      # - If background processing fails, the profile keeps the status it already had
      #   and the webhook reports the reason
