    # Send a message and follow what happened to it.
    #
    # One endpoint sends on any channel: pass `channel: "sent"` and we pick between
    # SMS, WhatsApp and RCS per recipient using your routing rules, or name a channel
    # to pin it. A send is accepted asynchronously — `POST /v3/messages` returns an
    # id, and delivery is reported through `GET /v3/messages/{id}`, its activities, or
    # a webhook.
    #
    # **A message needs a sender.** What you can send, where, and at what cost is
    # decided by the markets under **Channels** — so a recipient in a country you hold
    # no sender for is refused here rather than queued.
    #
    # **A message can be resent on its id.** `POST /v3/messages/{id}/resend` puts a
    # finished message — typically one BLOCKED for insufficient balance — back through
    # the send pipeline. It is a new attempt, not a free retry: every policy runs
    # again, the message is billed again, and its status webhooks fire again. A
    # FILTERED message is never resendable.
    #
    # **A scheduled message can be called off.** `POST /v3/messages/{id}/cancel`
    # cancels a send you scheduled with `scheduled_at`, as long as it has not been
    # released yet. Cancelling is free, fires `message.cancelled`, and is final — a
    # cancelled message cannot be resent.
    class Messages
      # Retrieves the activity log for a specific message. Activities track the message
      # lifecycle including acceptance, processing, sending, delivery, and any errors. A
      # SCHEDULED entry carries scheduled_at, the release instant in UTC as it stood at
      # that moment. Other entries have no scheduled_at key.

      # second message.scheduled webhook reports the new scheduled_at. An account may
