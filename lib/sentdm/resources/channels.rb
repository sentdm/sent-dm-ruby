      # The senders you send from, one per channel.
      #
      # **SMS is a list of markets**, each keyed by `(country, number_type)` — a
      # customer can hold `us/10dlc` and `gb/alphanumeric` at once, so a market is
      # addressed by the pair rather than by country alone. **WhatsApp and RCS are
      # single**: a customer has one business account and one agent. **Voice is per
      # number**: each number you hold can carry phone calls on its own
      # (`POST /v3/channels/voice`), each with the callback URL Sent asks what to do
      # with its calls, one of them is the default line for calls placed from your app,
      # and voice tokens are minted under `POST /v3/channels/voice/tokens`. Read your
      # voice numbers with `GET /v3/channels/voice` and change one with
      # `PATCH /v3/channels/voice/{number}`.
      #
      # ## Compliance lives on the market
      #
      # Adding a market records everything that market registers with, in its
      # `compliance` object. Only **US `TEN_DLC`** registers with a regime — The
      # Campaign Registry — and it is the only market whose compliance carries `brand`
      # and `campaign`. Everywhere else compliance is documents, and many markets ask
      # for none at all.
      #
      # `GET` and `PATCH` on a market return and accept the same shape, so what comes
      # back can be sent back: an omitted key is left alone, and a key reported in
      # `requirements` is the path into the body that clears it.
      #
      # Call `GET /v3/compliance/requirements` first — it answers what a market demands
      # before you hold it, with a body you can fill in and post.
